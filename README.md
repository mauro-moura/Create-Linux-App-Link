# Create-Linux-App-Link

A quick python program to create link entries for AppImages in Linux.

## Usage

You just have to download this `create_links.py` file and put it inside a folder that will contain your folders of apps. I would recommend create a folder in your home directory with the name `Apps`.

You can download an standalone application, create a Folder with the application name, and then define the executable as the same name as the folder name.

If you want to add an icon, just put the file with .ico extension inside the app folder, and it'll just detect automatically.

And then, just run in your terminal (Inside the Apps folder):
```bash
python create_links.py
```
